# musicode
Converts text into a series of musical notes and plays them

Disclaimer: This is not a secure method of encryption. It's just for fun. The "decrypt" function is just the "encrypt" function reverse-engineered, which is not hard to do for anyone who knows how it works. In the future I will probably add RSA.

Note: I didn't put in all the incorrect input handling yet so can you just not input wrong pls and thank you have a nice day
